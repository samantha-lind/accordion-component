## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

Two key things I wasn't aware of previously (CSS):

1. Absolute positioning within an element (use relative positioning for the parent and absolute for the child);
2. Clip functionality to crop images

### Continued development

This was my first attempt to use the bootstrap accordion component and I struggled a bit with customisation. Through trial and error, I realised that less is more and it doesn't need to be overcomplicated.

### Useful resources

- [Absolute and relative positioning](https://css-tricks.com/absolute-positioning-inside-relative-positioning/) - This helped me understand how absolute positioning can work within an element, rather than the main page
- [CSS Clip](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip) - This explains the clip functionality -[Bootstrap Accordion] (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/components/accordion/) - This outlines the accordion component, although it's not super helpful in explaining how to easily customise it.
